            <h6 id="heading">Web Development:</h6>
            <p>Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet 
                (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). This can include web design, web content development, 
                client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce
                development. However, among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects 
                of building web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development can range from developing the simplest static
                single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, or 
                social network services.</p>
            <h6 id="heading">Web development as an industry</h6>    
            <p>Since the mid-1990s, web development has been one of the fastest growing industries in the world. 
                In 1995 there were fewer than 1,000 web development companies in the United States, but by 2005 
                there were over 30,000 such companies[citation needed] in the U.S. alone. The growth of this industry 
                is being pushed by large businesses wishing to sell products and services to their customers 
                and to automate business workflow.</p>
            <h6 id="heading">Security Considerations</h6>
            <p>Web development takes into account many security considerations, such as data entry error 
                checking through forms, filtering output, and encryption.[1] Malicious practices such as 
                SQL injection can be executed by users with ill intent yet with only primitive knowledge 
                of web development as a whole. Scripts can be exploited to grant unauthorized access to 
                malicious users trying to collect information such as email addresses, passwords and protected 
                content like credit card numbers.</p>
